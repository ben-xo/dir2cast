; Configuration for dir2cast by Ben XO. http://www.ben-xo.com/dir2cast

; This is an 'ini' file. Lines beginning with ';' are comments.
; All of the settings are commented-out by default. To set them, remove
; the ';' at the beginning of the line.

; dir2cast will look in 2 places for this file. 1st, it will look in
; the same folder as dir2cast.php. 2nd, it will look in the same folder 
; as your MP3s. 

; If you only have 1 podcast, or your settings apply to every dir2cast 
; podcast on your website, then this file should be placed in 
; the same folder as dir2cast.php.

; If you have several podcasts being served from one copy of dir2cast,
; then you can make copies of this file with different settings and put 
; them in the folders where your MP3s are. Then they will override
; the settings from the site-wide dir2cast.ini.

; N.B. Although most settings do not need double-quotes (" ") around them, 
; it is safer to use them anyway. In particular, any setting with an 
; ampersand (&) character will probably fail unless you use double-quotes.
; (e.g. a URL with parameters, or the iTunes Society & Culture category.)



; ***** GLOBAL SETTINGS *** usually OK to leave unspecified ******************

; The following 3 settings are not mandatory because dir2cast should be
; able to figure them out for itself. Also, you can only specify them in 
; the dir2cast.ini that is in the same folder as dir2cast.php.

; The full filesystem path to the MP3 folder
; Set this if you *do not* want the folder to be passed in the URL.
; (This defaults to the same folder as the script)
;MP3_DIR = /home/ben_xo/public_html/my_mp3_folder

; The base to look for folders if they are specified in the URL
; Set this if you *do* want the folder passed in the URL, but the passed
; folders are not subfolders of where you installed dir2cast.php.
; (This defaults to the same folder as the script)
;MP3_BASE = /home/ben_xo/public_html/

; The URL of the MP3 folder
; This defaults to the directory of the script.
; dir2cast can usually work this out for you, but under some circumstances
; it will fail. If your MP3 URLs are all wrong, try putting this in manually.
;MP3_URL = http://www.example.foo/my_mp3_folder/

; Uncomment this if you want to check in every sub-folder for new files as well.
;RECURSIVE_DIRECTORY_ITERATOR = true



; *** INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PODCAST - you SHOULD set this how you like it ***

;COPYRIGHT = "Ben XO (%YEAR%)"

; This defaults to the URL of the script or http://www.example.com/
;LINK = "http://www.ben-xo.com/"

; The title of the feed.
; This defaults to the name of the directory you're casting

; 
; Here is an example which means "Both the 'Music' category and
; the 'Gadgets' subcategory of 'Technology'
;
; Please note that the entire setting must have double quotes ("")
; like in the example, otherwise categories with '&' in the name won't work
;ITUNES_CATEGORIES = "Music, Technology > Gadgets"

; Whether or not the feed contains explicit content.
; See https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/wiki/Spec:-iTunes-Podcast-RSS
; Valid values are "yes", "explicit", "true" or "no", "clean", "false"
;

;ITUNES_EXPLICIT = "no"


; *** INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PODCAST - the following can be set using text files ***

; Description of the feed
;
; This defaults to empty, or if the file 'description.txt' exists
; in the MP3 dir, or in the same dir as the script, that will be read 
; and the contents used
;
; It's usually better to set this in 'description.txt' because you can
; write a whole lot more that way.
;DESCRIPTION = "My First Podcast"

; Subtitle of the feed for iTunes
;
; This defaults to DESCRIPTION, or if the file 'itunes_subtitle.txt' exists
; in the MP3 dir, or in the same dir as the script, that will be read

;ITUNES_IMAGE = "http://www.somewhere.com/podcast.jpg"

; Extra text for the 'iTunes Subtitle', which appears next to each episode
; 
; Defaults to empty. The text will appear in the iTunes subtitle for each 
; item of the podcast. For example, if you put an entire tracklist into the MP3 
; comment field, you could set this to ". Click here for tracklist -->", and
; the the subtitle will read "<ArtistName>. Click here for tracklist -->"
; 
;ITUNES_SUBTITLE_SUFFIX = ""

; 'album - artist - title' from your ID3 tag.
;LONG_TITLES = false

; Automatically extract cover images from the files in the feed so they
; can become the episode image. This will never overwrite a file that
; you uploaded manually, but if dir2cast doesn't have write permissions
; in your podcast folder then it will fail. So, then perhaps turn it off.
;AUTO_SAVE_COVER_ART = true


; *** THESE SHOULD BE LEFT AS THEY ARE - unless you have a good reason. ***

; Files must be at least this old to be included in the feed. If they are
; younger than this it might indicate that they are still being uploaded.
; 
; Defaults to 30 seconds
;MIN_FILE_AGE = 30

; Number of seconds for which the cache files are guaranteed valid; that is
; to say, if you generate a new feed, and then hit refresh a lot, it will
; not regenerate the feed again for at least this length of time.

; You can only specify this in the dir2cast.ini that is in the same folder as
; dir2cast.php.

;TTL = 60

; force the RSS feed to be regenerated (bypassing and replacing the cached 
; copy). If this is empty then this feature is disabled. 
;FORCE_PASSWORD =

; If you want the script to write the RSS to a file instead of to stdout
; you can set OUTPUT_FILE. This is useful if your RSS takes a long time 
; to generate and you would not ever want a podcast client to trigger a 
; cache refresh. You probably would want to setup dir2cast.php so only
; You run it after adding new files to the directory.
;OUTPUT_FILE =

; If you want to change the type attribute on the atom:link element 
; to something other than 'application/rss+xml' you can set it here.
;ATOM_TYPE =

; If you want the <description> tag for an item to come from the summary (auto-
; generated, or from a file with the same name with .txt extension) then
; set this parameter to 'summary'. Otherwise it will get its description from
; comment tag embedded in the file.
;DESCRIPTION_SOURCE=comment

; If you want to have HTML in your <description> tag set this parameter.
; Otherwise the content of the description will be escaped with htmlspecialchars()
