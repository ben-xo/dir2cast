Changelog
=========

1.38 2023-01-05 * Add <itunes:type> defaulting to "episodic". The ITUNES_TYPE
                  option in dir2cast.ini will let you set the  feed to
                  <itunes:type>serial<itunes:type> set, and then,
                  for each episode, the "Part Of A Set" tag (TPOS), if filled,
                  will be used to output an <itunes:season> tag, and the 
                  "Track Number" tag (TRCK), if filled, will be used to output
                  an <itunes:episode> tag. See the .ini for usage info.
                  Suggested by @EdwarDDay (#65)
                * Fix deprecation warning in PHP 8.2, and tested up to PHP 8.3

1.37 2022-10-27 * Errors now return an HTTP status code 500 by default.
                * If the error is due to no content, or a bad URL passed to
                  ?dir=, then it will be a 404 and no information about
                  the server paths will be returned in the output. Thanks
                  to @EdwarDDay for this security suggestion. (#64)
                * fix nasty bug where paths were sometimes invalid due to
                  mishandling of trailing slashes (#55)

1.36 2022-08-25 * Fix bug where podcasts with autosaved cover art would end up
                  with duplicated iTunes metadata tags. Thanks once again to
                  @EdwarDDay for the bug report.

1.35 2022-08-24 * Image files extracted from podcast cover art are now placed
                  in the correct sub folder, if you organise your podcasts by
                  sub folder. Thanks to @EdwarDDay for the bug report!

1.34 2022-07-28 * Add support for M4B audiobook files as requested by @crosbyh
                  Many thanks for your support!

1.33 2022-05-25 * README fixed by @denilsonsa - thanks!
                * Caching algorithm changed to so that it is no longer dependent
                  on added media files having a newer file date (GitHub #51),
                  and will look for any changes in filesize or date, as well
                  as addition or removal of files. This means that dir2cast is
                  now much more friendly to use cases for local media collections.

1.32 2022-04-18 * Upgrade getID3 (includes important security fix for PHP 8+)

1.31 2021-12-30 * Some fixes for future deprecation warnings as we approach PHP 8.2
                * Debugging options and more tests
                * Podcast will now refresh if you update any of the feed metadata 
                  files (description.txt, image.jpg etc) even if you don't update 
                  any of the media files.


1.30 2021-03-17 * Fix nasty bug when refreshing podcasts due to a newly
                  uploaded file removing all the links and replacing them
                  with file paths.

                * Compatibility fix with PHP 5.3

1.29 2021-03-01 * Proper fix for Last-modified header to use the date within
                  the cached podcast.

1.28 2021-03-01 * Fixes for caching so it properly ignores files which are still
                  mid-upload
                * Now sends Content-length header
                * Fix for Last-modified header when podcast was cached

1.27 2021-02-28 Fix other blocker bugs ($argv / CLI_ONLY related)

1.26 2021-02-28 Fix #47 Undefined variable $argv

1.25 2021-02-26 Prevent scanning of files which are still being uploaded, and
                add min-file-age option to adjust this

1.24 2021-02-26 Add a comprehensive unit test suite!

                A bunch of changes designed for better code re-use, such as not 
                 using defines inside classes, and allowing programmatic
                 overriding of properties of RSS items.

                Fixes to the generation of the media base URL.

                Better handling of image URLs.

                Don't save images from media files if one already exists but it's
                 of a different type than the one in the media file.

                Fix a bug when DESCRIPTION_SOURCE is summary and summary is the default
                  (which is the description).

                Allow generation of empty podcasts on the CLI (mostly for testing)

                Upgrades to getID3 to fix a few other bugs I encountered during testing.


1.23 2020-02-23 Use the filename of a media file as the default title instead
                of (untitled). Suggestion by wesyah234

1.22 2020-01-19 iTunes categories now use comma instead of pipe as a separator.
                Characters which are valid UTF-8 but invalid XML are removed.
                Most ini examples updated to use double quotes.

1.21 2020-01-10 Uncache the podcast when the configuration changes, making it
                quicker and easier to experiment with settings.

1.20 2019-12-30 Cache files per media-file, which speeds up large podcasts
                Upgrade bundled getID3 with better MP4 support
                Support for <itunes:explicit> tag
                General speed improvements

1.19 2019-12-21 Extract cover art from MP4 and M4A files.

1.18 2019-12-21 Bugfix for image URLs. Better CLI options.

1.15 2019-12-16 Other fixes for PHP7.x
                Upgrade getID3 to 1.9.18-201911300717 - fixes PHP7.4 support

1.14 2019-12-12 Support for mp4 videos

1.13 2019-12-11 Suppress deprecation warnings, as both dir2cast and getID3
                trigger the error handler on newer PHPs

1.12 2018-03-22 Switched to de-facto text/xml content-type
                Suggested by RobertBozic

1.11 2018-02-28 Added charset=utf-8 to the Content-type header.
                Suggested by RobertBozic

1.10 2018-01-21 Added RECURSIVE_DIRECTORY_ITERATOR option for scanning nested
                folders. Suggested by ognjiscar

1.9.1 18-01-21 Small PHP7 fix.

1.9 2017-12-27 Merged changes from cbz:
               * Upgraded getID3
               * Added support for M4A files

1.8 2016-07-04 Merged changes from Jeff Bearer:
               * Added support for PNG podcast cover art
               * create tempdir if it does not already exist
               * support for item specific images
               * support for writing output to an RSS file

               * customizable content type
               * add option to have <description> populated by description.txt

1.7.2 14-03-06 Update homepage information in file to the GitHub.

1.7.1 11-02-17 Remove unused mpc_old code from getID3, which false-positived
               on one of my MP3s.

1.7 2010-12-10 <itunes:summary> is now excluded if it's not explicitly set, as
               iTunes will happily fall back to the <description> and there's
               no point duplicating this. Changed <itunes:subtitle> to pull from
               ID3 Artist field, rather than ID3 Album field, as this is more
               useful for me. <itunes:subtitle> can now be set with a file in
               the same was as <itunes:summary>. Also added new INI parameter
               ITUNES_SUBTITLE_SUFFIX, which is appended to the subtitle of 
               every item. I suggest using this for an appropriate 'Click here
               for more info!' message, to lead people to the description or
               summary.

1.6 2010-11-27 Fix bug including summary info from either ID3 album field
               or filename.txt reported by Nilicule. Thanks!

1.5 2010-07-31 Add optional RSS <image> tag. This is not the same as the 
               <itunes:image> tag, as it has size restrictions. 

1.4 2010-03-10 Make <description> in a CDATA section

1.3 2009-05-28 Fixed nasty regeneration bug where no items in the feed would
               get any metadata after adding a file to the feed. The workaround
               was to clear the cache, but this update fixes it. Also, make
               the feed more robust against getID3's handling of broken MP3s.

1.2 2009-05-04 Changed the contents of the <title> tag per item. Added a new 
               configuration option LONG_TITLE to enable the old behaviour.
               Added new URL parameter ?force=password to enable clearing of
               the cache if, for some reason, the URL is not generated
               correctly.

1.1 2009-04-23 Fix an error in the default dir2cast.ini

1.0 2008-03-17 Fixed a couple of bugs with incomplete ID3 tags.
               The most-common case, that of hitting the cache, has been 
               streamlined so that it doesn't hit the defaults-setup code
               or parse the .ini files unless necessary.

0.9 2008-03-02 Added .ini file configuration, added MP3_BASE option.

0.8 2008-02-27 Fixed ?dir= so it works intuitively, and much more safely.

0.7 2008-02-25 W3 feed validator conformance fixes and fixed itunes:image.

0.6 2008-02-25 Updated the licensing information.

0.5 2008-02-25 Fixed losing itunes item tags when a dir changes.

0.4 2008-02-24 Added a whole error handler with pretty errors

0.3 2008-02-24 Fixed the auto URL detection code. Made the config clearer.
               Renamed some of the config parameters for clarity.

0.2 2008-02-23 Fixed bug with missing '/' and wrong urlencoding on spaces.

0.1 2008-02-22 Initial Release
